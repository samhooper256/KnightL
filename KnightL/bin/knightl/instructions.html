    <h1>KnightL Instructions</h1>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
      This is an app that shows you a knight on a chessboard and calculates the
      shortest path from the knight's position to any selected tile.
      The movement rules of the knight,
      the board size, and the enabled tiles can be adjusted by the user. To
      display the shortest path to a tile, simply click on a desired destination
      tile and numbers will appear indicating the order of moves the knight must
      take to get there. If a tile cannot be reached by any sequence of moves,
      an 'X' appears on the tile.
    </p>
    <h2>Movement Controls</h2>
    <p>
      The two input boxes on the left, "A move" and "B move," control the knight's
      movement. By default, a knight in chess must move two tiles in one direction then
      one tile in a direction perpendicular to the first. These rules
      can be changed so that the knight must move <em>A</em> tiles in one direction
      and <em>B</em> tiles in a perpendicular one. Note that swapping the values of
      A and B will produce the same rule set. A and B cannot both be zero.
    </p>
    <h2>Disabled Tiles</h2>
    <p>
      Tiles can be disabled or enabled. If a tile is disabled, the knight will
      not be allowed to step on that tile. Disabled tiles will restrict the
      knight's movement and can make accessing some spots impossible.
      You can enable/disable a tile by right-clicking it.
      A tile will become gray when disabled.
      By default, all tiles are enabled.
    </p>
    <h2>Other Features</h2>
    <p>
      In order to change the starting point of the knight, simply middle-click
      a new starting tile. The knight cannot be moved to disabled tiles. If you
      would like to see the knight move along his path, you can use the
      left and right arrow keys while a path is selected (i.e. there are
      numbers on the board) to watch him traverse the path. You can change the
      size of the chessboard up to a maximum of 25x25 tiles with the slider in
      the bottom left. The sidebar panel can be resized by dragging the divider
      between the board and the sidebar left or right. There are some useful
      utility buttons located in the bottom left.
